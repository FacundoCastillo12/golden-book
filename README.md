This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Work In Progress!

## Introduction

Golden Book is a website designed with the purpose of allowing authors to create and share their works, while also enabling readers to read, save, and share their favorite stories.

On a personal level, this project was created with the intention of working with Typescript in React and improving my FrontEnd skills, with a focus on creating an attractive and pleasant design for both readers and authors alike, as well as the general public. My goal is to extend this project to the backend using NestJS.

## Technologies

This project was created with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The following were used:

## Features

1. A homepage that displays important notices, daily recommendations, and editor's picks. It also provides access to the "Latest updates" and "Top Ranking". To give readers more freedom, we have added "Best of the Week", "Latest Releases", "Must-Reads", and "Popular Genres" sections.
2. The login, register, and forgot password sections have been designed with the aim of making it easy for authors or readers to access their accounts or register.
3. **In progress**: Dynamically configuring the layout of each novel with its URL. This is where you can see details of the novel, such as genres, synopsis, number of chapters, readers, views, and author. You can also leave reviews and find all reviews in one place. (The base design has been included and is under development.)
